# CapTouch
This repository is dedicated to information, instructions, and data related to the NIEHS Neurobehavioral Core's Capacitive Touch Project. We hope you enjoy!

# Additional Data for Paper
Within this folder contains raw data to support our recent manuscript, "3D-Printed Capacitive Sensor Objects for Object Recognition Assays", recently published at eNeuro.

CapTouch 1.0: this folder includes excel files that provide the raw data used to validate our CapTouch 1.0 capacitive sensing system.

CapTouch 2.0: this folder includes excel files that provide the raw data used to validate our CapTouch 2.0 capacitive sensing system.

# Other Files
CapTouchAdapterScheamtic_V2: contains an engineering sketch for the captouch board configuration used in the paper.

MIDI_with_LED: Arduino code uploaded to the Bare Conductive Touch Boards used to adjust the sensitivity thresholds.
